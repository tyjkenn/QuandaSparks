This was a school project created by Ty Kennington and Stephen Brown
for the 2012 annual showcase at the Center for Advanced Research and
Technology.

QuandaSparks is Q&A chatbot designed to spark ideas for journal writing. 
It was originally designed as a desktop Java application and later ported 
to Android.

The interface functions much like a texting. Quanda will begin by asking
you a simple question about your day. Based on your response, it will then
search through its knowledge base to construct an appropriate follow-up.
Quanda isn't going to pass the Turing test, but it uses template responses
to seem like a better listener. The conversation can then be saved in a text
file for later review.

While no robot learning has been added, Quanda also records whenever it is
stumped, so the data can be used to update the knowledge base.
